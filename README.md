# T-488-MAPP-Project1

## ANDROID ##
For some reason we could not load the posters from the api. We asked an instructure about the problem, he could not find anything wrong with the code, and told us not to worry about it because we seemed to have everything correct code-wise.

## IOS ##
The project seems to have some errors, that we are not able to fix. 
When you first go to the Top Rated tap nothing happens until you tap it again, then it works like it should. 
If you have activated the Top Rated tab and then change tabs the program starts to populate the the Top Rated list again and then it thorws an NullReferenceException.
When you search for a movie you have the HUGE probability to get an UnauthorizedAccessExeption that says we are denied access to the folder where the posters are stored.
